# Using MongoDB as a Database

## Start MongoDB

To start the service type `brew services start mongodb-community@4.4` in the terminal.

The service may be stopped using `brew services stop mongodb-community@4.4` in the terminal.

## Creating the Database and Schema

No action is needed, as initializing the connection will automatically handle the database and table creation.
